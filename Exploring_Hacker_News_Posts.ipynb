    "This project is about analyzing information from the Hacker News Posts (HN) dataset of submissions to a technology site [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments and, depending on a number of comments and positive or negative votes, can be raised in the feed of posts or lowered down, similar to reddit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\". Users submit \"Ask HN\" posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit \"Show HN\" posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting. We will compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "- Do \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\" receive more comments and number of points on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments and number of points on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the the Hacker News Posts dataset [here](http://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but note that we have reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that didn't receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "- `id`: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post;\n",
    "- `title`: the title of the post;\n",
    "- `url`: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL;\n",
    "- `num_points`: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes;\n",
    "- `num_comments`: the number of comments on the post;\n",
    "- `author`: the username of the person who submitted the post;\n",
    "- `created_at`: the date and time of the post's submission."
